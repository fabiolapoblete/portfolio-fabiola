                    <p>Two years ago i made a career switch to pursue my dream of becoming a developer, and I haven't looked back since. I have a background in meteorology with a bachelor's degree in physics and dedicated eight years at SMHI where I explored diverse roles and fields.</p>
                    <p>My career has involved diverse roles, from guiding captains worldwide to delivering weather forecasts on national radio and issuing critical weather warnings. In the midst of these experiences, I found a real interest in technology and development.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my studies, I've worn the hats of both project manager and junior developer, finding great joy in these roles. The challenges of coding and problem-solving is energizing, and I've continuously sought opportunities to expand my technical expertise.</p>
